=============== Version Control Systems ===============
<!-- BTW I believe BitBucket is better than Github (personal prefernce) -->

1. Main features of a Version Control System
  a) Atomic Operations -> This means when the user makes a edit, and they want to save it, it makes a group of the final changes for the commit
  b) Version Archive -> Basically what this means is that, say you have a java class named Cookie.java and you make a change adding how large the cookie is, and commit it,
     the VCS will save the new update as a commit and the old one, so you can go visit the old one and the new one.
  c) File Locking -> This means that if a user is editing a file, only they can edit it with write access at the time, until they are finished, no one else can write access it.
  d) Integration -> I have experience with this personally, when I do have my code on BitBucket, I have Intellij pull and push any commits / updates
    that I may have done, so others can see.
    
2. VCS is usually used by software engineers and developers because of how useful it is. It allows them to push updates they made maybe to a group project
   for others to pull it and for them to work on it. If there is an error in a new build, the VCS keeps copies of every single change may it just be adding a space
   and they highlight and point it out. This will be helpful in this class because as new developers this would be helpful because if we manage to make a mistake
   we can always go back to an old version to check where we went wrong. It also allows the teacher to view any changes that we may have done.
