=============== Version Control Systems ===============
<!-- BTW I believe BitBucket is better than Github (personal prefernce) -->

1. Main features of a Version Control System
  a) Atomic Operations -> This means when the user makes a edit, and they want to save it, it makes a group of the final changes for the commit
  b) Version Archive -> Basically what this means is that, say you have a java class named Cookie.java and you make a change adding how large the cookie is, and commit it,
     the VCS will save the new update as a commit and the old one, so you can go visit the old one and the new one.
  c) File Locking -> This means that if a user is editing a file, only they can edit it with write access at the time, until they are finished, no one else can write access it.
  d) Integration -> I have experience with this personally, when I do have my code on BitBucket, I have Intellij pull and push any commits / updates
    that I may have done, so others can see.
    
2. VCS is usually used by software engineers and developers because of how useful it is. It allows them to push updates they made maybe to a group project
   for others to pull it and for them to work on it. If there is an error in a new build, the VCS keeps copies of every single change may it just be adding a space
   and they highlight and point it out. This will be helpful in this class because as new developers this would be helpful because if we manage to make a mistake
   we can always go back to an old version to check where we went wrong. It also allows the teacher to view any changes that we may have done.

3. 'Collabration' -> Github will help the teacher collabrate with us because of easy it is to use. If we are having lots of trouble we could show the teacher
   the code, are they could help us. When working in a group pushing commits to Github will allow our members to see our code and they could learn or improve on 
   it. When they need to see something, they could because it's always online.
   
4. 'Backup' -> Github will keep backups of every single file and edit you make. These are called commits; commits declare and state all the changes you made 
   to any given file at a time. It could be anything from adding a space, to creating or deleting an entire file.
   
5. 'Version Control' -> Github will keep every single update you make to a file or to your repository. Like if you add a person to the repository to make edits
   Github will log that, if you create a new paragraph of text, it will save the old one and the new one.
   
6. 'Distributed Access' -> Distributed Access Control System (DACS)[1] is a light-weight single sign-on and attribute-based access control system for web servers and server-based software. (Wikipedia) 
    -> My Explanation: Github distributed access will be used in the course because all the files are being shared throughout the web service. Github is controlled by some system, most likely custom coded
       which then allows users to signup and create new code repositories.
